### CPSC 1181: Object-oriented Computing
Course Description:<br/>
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm to design and develop software based on the concept of objects. Students are introduced to the fundamental concepts of programming from an object-oriented (OO) perspective: 
abstraction; objects; classes and class hierarchies; methods; encapsulation and information hiding; inheritance; polymorphism. 
Students learn and practice the application of OO design with modeling tools (e.g., class diagrams), 
container/collection classes, event-driven programming, exception handling, GUI, multi-threading, and networking. 
The focus is placed on good software engineering principles using a language that supports the OO paradigm.
